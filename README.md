# Quantum Europe
This repository contains all the basic quantum city functions as well as functions to connect the Quantum Cities through satellites or drones.

It requires the installation of Netsquid (see https://netsquid.org/ ) and of the orekit package if you want to generate new satellite data. 

All the functions are in the file QEuropeFunctions file and example files are available to show how they work.

All the parameters can be changed in the QEuropeFunctions file or directly when calling the functions.
